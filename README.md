## Installation
Install package through Atom or use CLI:

```bash
$ apm install linter-julia
```

In order to use this package, you will need to install Julia and Lint.jl
(version 0.2.6 or higher).
To get Julia see: http://julialang.org/downloads/ and to get Lint.jl
see: https://github.com/tonyhffong/Lint.jl#installation


Before [Lint.jl version 0.2.6 is released](https://github.com/tonyhffong/Lint.jl/releases),
you will need to do `Pkg.checkout("Lint")` after `Pkg.add("Lint")` command.
This will use the latest development version of the Lint.jl package.
After the version 0.2.6 is realeased, you can do `Pkg.free("Lint")`.


## Features

* User can give path to the julia, which they want to use for Linting
* Ignore the messages you don't need
